# Lisp in Small Pieces via Clojure

_Lisp in Small Pieces_ by Christian Queinnec, 2003 edition, translated to English by Kathleen Callaway

I've started going through this book, but rather than learning Scheme while also
learning the topics presented in the book, I've decided to attempt implementing
the examples in Clojure.  We'll see how it goes!
